["fish.html", "Fish Background Average fish abundance by species", " Fish Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report Background Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program. Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW’s Fisheries Branch based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. :::::: Average fish abundance by species Sacramento Splittail Figure 1: picture of a sacramento splittail Figure 2: Graph of average Sacramento Splittail catch per unit effort from 1998 to 2018.
