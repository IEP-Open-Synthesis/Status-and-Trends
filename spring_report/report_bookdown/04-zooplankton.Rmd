# Zooplankton {#zooplankton}

### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report


:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
## Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

## Average Spring Zooplankton Biomass by Region 


:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="30%"}

<center> __San Pablo Bay__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 25.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/zoops_splspring.png"))
```

In 2018, San Pablo Bay had much lower than average biomass, mostly calanoid copepods

<center> __Suisun__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/zoops_ssspring.png"))
```

In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass.

<center> __Delta__ </center>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/zoops_dtspring.png"))
```

In 2018, the Delta also had much lower than average total biomass.
