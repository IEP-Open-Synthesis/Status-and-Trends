### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report

## Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

## Average Spring Zooplankton Biomass by Region

<center> __San Pablo Bay__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3 to 24.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","zoop_splspring.png"))
```

In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","zoop_ssspring.png"))
```

In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average.

<center> __Delta__ </center>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","chla_dtspring.png"))
```

In 2018, the Delta had lower clorophyll than average.
