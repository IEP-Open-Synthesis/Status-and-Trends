# Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 {#fishrecent}

### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report

## Background

* Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The [CDFW 20mm Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/20mm-Survey) was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. 
* Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends.
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWSâ€™s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. 



## Average fish abundance by species

```

The Delta Smelt 20mm index was zero in 2018, the lowest index on record.

<center> __Longfin smelt__ </center>

```{r fig.cap= "Graph of post-larval longfin smelt index from 2004-2018. Values range from 4 to 206.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/20mm_LFS_recent.png"))
```

Adult Longfin smelt abundance in 2018 was much lower than the long-term average.

```{r fig.cap= "picture of a juvenile salmon", fig.align='center', fig.width=1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/fsd-chinook-salmon-smolt-stage-small.jpg"))

```


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 2004 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/DJFMP_chinook_winterByLength_recyears.png"))
```

In 2018, juvenile winter-run salmon survival was about average.
