# Secchi Depth {#secchi}

### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report


:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
## Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWRâ€™s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Secchi Depth by Region 


:::::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="30%"}

<center> __San Pablo Bay__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","secchi_splspring.png"))
```

In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average.

::: {.column width="30%"}
<center> __Suisun__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","secchi_ssspring.png"))
```

In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average

<center> __Delta__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","secchi_dtspring.png"))
```

In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest Spring on record.
