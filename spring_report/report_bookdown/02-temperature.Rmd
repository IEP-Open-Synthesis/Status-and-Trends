# Water Temperature {#water-temperature}

### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report


:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
## Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWRâ€™s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges.
* Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction.
* Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Temperature by Region

::: {.column width="30%"}

<center> __San Pablo Bay__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring water temperature in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/temp_splspring.png"))
```

In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average.

<center> __Suisun__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring water temperature in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/temp_ssspring.png"))
```

In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average.

<center> __Delta__ </center>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of average spring water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/temp_dtspring.png"))
```

In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average.
