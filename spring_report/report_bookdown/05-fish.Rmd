### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report

## Background

* Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s [Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.233.2). 
* Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW's [Fisheries Branch ](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/sacramento/data/query_adult_grandtab.html) based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. 
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

2018 was lower than the long-term average.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/SpringRun_1966.png"))
```

In 2018, adult Chinook returns were lower than average

```{r fig.cap= "picture of a juvenile salmon", fig.align='center', fig.width=1, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/fsd-chinook-salmon-smolt-stage-small.jpg"))

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 1995 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..","figures/DJFMP_chinook_winterByLength_allyears.png"))
```

In 2018, juvenile winter-run salmon survival was about average.
