 Long-term ecological surveys have been a core function of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) since the program’s inception in the 1970s. The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report.  The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication.

# Spring Report {#Spring}


#### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season Report
This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for March through May from 1966 to 2018.


<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mean is represented by a dotted red line"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","mline.png"))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","spring_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases.
- The spring of 2018 had slightly lower outflow than average.

## Spring Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns2}

::: {.column width=700px}

### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Spring Water Temperature 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width=800px}
### Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges.
* Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction.
* Temperatures tend to be similar between regions in the spring.

## Spring Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Spring Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

## Spring Fish 

### Background

* Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. Juvenile splittail are sampled by DWR’s [Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.233.2)'s rotory screw trap. 
* Spring-run Adult salmon return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW's [Fisheries Branch ](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/sacramento/data/query_adult_grandtab.html) based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. 
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

## Recent Trends: Spring Fish 2004-2018 

### Background

* Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The [CDFW 20mm Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/20mm-Survey) was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. 
* Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends.
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

# Summer Report {#Summer}

#### Interagency Ecological Program Summer Season Report

This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for June through August from 1966 to 2018.

<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mean is represented by a dotted red line"}

```

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="average summer Delta outflow",}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","summer_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Summer flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports.
- The summer of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average.

### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Summer Water Temperature 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* High temperature can increase productivity and may trigger harmful algal blooms.
* Increasing Summer temperatures may limit juvenile smelt survival.
* Summer temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Summer Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the summer.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Summer Zooplankton

### Background

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}

* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in summer tends to be the highest of the year, particularly for the calanoid copepod *Pseudodiaptomous forbesi*.

## Summer Fish 

### Background

* Delta Smelt, listed as threatened by the Endangered Species Act, have been tracked by [CDFW’s Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey) since 1959 in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and the Delta. 
* Northern Anchovy are an important forage fish in the brackish-saline regions of the estuary. They are sampled best by [CDFW’s San Francisco Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study).
* Sacramento Pikeminnow is a native cyprinid that is one of the few piscivorous native fish in the Delta. They are sampled by [USFWS's DJFMP](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm) beach seine surveys throughout the estuary.

## Recent Trends: Summer 2004-2018 

### Background

* Delta Smelt have been in severe decline over the past two decades, with a [Summer Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey)  index of zero in 2015, 2016 and 2018.
* *Microcystis* is a toxic cyanobacteria first found in the Delta in 1998. *Microcystis* presence has been documented by the [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) and the  [CDFW Summer Townet Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey) during their water quality sampling.
* Aquatic vegetation in the Delta has increased significantly in recent years. This vegetation is composed mostly of non-native invasive plant species and is categorized as either floating or submerged types. Coverage is estimated by [UC-Davis](http://cstars.metro.ucdavis.edu/) using remote sensing of the North and Central Delta.

# Fall Report {#Fall}

#### Interagency Ecological Program Fall Season Report

This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for September through November from 1966 to 2018.


<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap="mean is represented by a dotted red line"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","mline.png"))
```


```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","fall_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Fall flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports.
- The fall of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average.

## Fall Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Fall Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the fall.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Fall Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in fall tends to be higher than winter, but lower than summer.

## Fall Fish 

### Background

* The Fall Midwater Trawl began in 1967 and surveys the pelagic, or open water, fish community.  Indices for many pelagic fishes are at record lows, including Delta and Longfin Smelt which are  protected by California and/or federal Endangered Species Acts.
* White Sturgeon is a species of concern and a popular target of recreational fishing. Catch per unit
effort is based on trammel net surveys.
* Fall Run Chinook Salmon, an important species for both the commercial and recreational fishery, is  also a species of concern. Population dynamics are driven by hatchery production and a suite of  environmental variables. Totals counts of both in-river and hatchery returns are shown here.

## Recent Trends: Fall Fish 2004-2018 

### Background

* Many pelagic fishes declined sharply around 2001 in what is known as the Pelagic Organism  Decline. Some species have continued to decline over the last 15 years.
* For Delta Smelt, 2018 marked the lowest recorded index on record (Index = 0).
* Most other pelagic fish also had low catch in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the long-term average.

# Winter Report {#Winter}


#### Interagency Ecological Program Winter Season Report
This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for September through November of 1966 to 2018.

<h2>Winter Delta Outflow</h2>

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","winter_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Winter flow is driven primarily by rainfall and upstream dam releases.
- The winter of 2018 had lower outflow than average.

## Winter Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Winter Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling during the winter did not begin until 1995. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in winter tends to be the lowest of the year.

## Winter Fish 

### Background

* White sturgeon support a recreational fishery. Juvenile sturgeon are sampled by in the [CDFW Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) , which samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.
* Longfin Smelt are listed as Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. Spawning adults are sampled in winter by the [CDFW Bay Study](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study) midwater trawl. 
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon are sampled by the [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

## Recent Trends: Winter Fish 2004-2018 

### Background

* Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The [CDFW Spring Kodiak Trawl](https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Spring-Kodiak-Trawl) was designed to sample spawning Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta.
* Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so are better sampled by the CDFW Bay Study. The Bay Study samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.
* Juvenile Chinook pass Red Bluff Diversion Dam on the upper Sacramento as they migrate from spawning grounds to the ocean.

### Interagency Ecological Program Seasonal Monitoring Report

* Version: 1.0
* Last Updated: 2020-04-13

Report developed by:

* Rosemary Hartman (California Department of Water Resources (CDWR, Rosemary.Hartman@water.ca.gov)
* Nicholas Rasmussen (CDWR)
* Lara Mitchell (US Fish and Wildlife Service)
* JohnFranco Saraceno (CDWR)
* David Bosworth (CDWR)
* Jason DuBois (California Department of Fish and Wildlife)
* Michael Koohafkan (CDWR)
* Louise Conrad (Delta Science Program)
* Sam Bashevkin (Delta Science Program)

## Overview
Long-term ecological surveys have been a core function of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) since the program’s inception in the 1970s. The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. While the report is not a comprehensive view of all the data collected by IEP, it is intended to provide a general overview of the longevity and breadth of IEP survey work. A major goal of this report is to illustrate the scope of IEP surveys and emerging trends in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem to the public, potential science collaborators, and IEP and other resource agency managers and directors. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication. 

## General Information

### Season Definitions
This report covers a suite of key IEP data sets relevant each season.For data sets collected throughout the year, such as water temperature, we only used data from this three-month period to generate graphs. For data sets that are season-specific, we include the entire sampling period, even if it does not overlap exactly with our season definition (for example, the 20mm Survey index includes data from March-July, whereas the spring season is defined as March-May).

* Spring = March to May
* Summer = June to August, 
* Fall = September to November, and  
* Winter = December to February, with January and February included with December of the previous year

### Geographic Region Definitions
Many of the data sets in the report are represented by a panel of three plots, one for each of three geographic regions: San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This subdivision of data sets is designed to facilitate comparison among major regions that differ in a variety of characteristics. San Pablo Bay includes data collected east of Point San Pablo and west of the Carquinez Straight. Suisun Bay includes data collected east of the Carquinez Straight and west of the town of Collinsville. The Delta includes data east of Collinsville. Data sets are represented as a single graph when the data are only collected within a single region (e.g., Net Delta Outflow) and for wide-ranging organisms that frequent multiple regions (e.g., Delta Smelt).


```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Map of the estuary with circles around San Pablo Bay, Suisun, and the Delta"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","map.png"))
```
Figure 1. Map of geographic regions of the Estuary. 



### Year Ranges
Most of the graphs in the report have an x-axis range from 1966 to 2018. This start year was selected because it is the year of initiation for the Fall Midwater Trawl survey, one of the longest-running surveys. Standardizing the year range on the x-axis facilitates visual comparison across data sets. The entire time series for nearly all data sets fits within this time range.  Data sets that started before 1966 were truncated in this report, for purposes of consistency within the report. The graphs in the Recent Trends section of the report range from 2004 to 2018. 

### Calculations for Data Points
The points plotted on the graphs represent mean values. Means are generated by averaging data over the three months of the season for a given year and across sites within a given region where relevant (e.g., water quality and plankton data sets). The dotted horizontal line indicates the average value over the entire period of record.

### Delta Smelt, Striped Bass, Longfin Smelt, American Shad: Fall Midwater Trawl  (Fall Report)

+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife
+ Metric Used: Annual abundance indices are the sum of the four (September-December) monthly indices, which are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 17 areas.
+ Year Range: 1967 – 2017. Note: No sampling in 1974 or 1979. Also, the month range of this survey deviates from the standard September -November definition of fall in this report. It typically takes place September – December. In some years past, however, it started as early as July and/or ended as late as March.
Stations: 100 (out of 122 stations sampled)
+ Additional Information: [http://www.dfg.ca.gov/delta/projects.asp?ProjectID=FMWT](http://www.dfg.ca.gov/delta/projects.asp?ProjectID=FMWT)

+ Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Sturgeon-Study


### Juvenile White Sturgeon: San Francisco Bay Study (Winter Report)

+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, San Francisco Bay Study (Region 3, Bay Delta)
+ Metric Used: Year-class index (YCI) calculated by methods described in Fish 2010
+ Data source: Fish CPUE and Index calc_July2019.accdb (standalone database, copy received from Bay Study personnel)

+ Stations: 52
+ Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study

### Adult Longfin Smelt and Northern Anchovy: San Francisco Bay Study (Winter and Summer Reports)

+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, San Francisco Bay Study (Region 3, Bay Delta)
+ Metric Used: Average catch per unit effort (CPUE) for adult (Age 1+) Longfin Smelt is derived from Bay  Study’s Midwater trawl, which samples pelagic fishes and retrieved obliquely such that all depths are sampled equally.
+ Year Range: 1980-2017
+ Stations: 52
+ Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study

### Winter Run Chinook: Red Bluff Diversion Dam (Winter Report)

+ Data Source: Red Bluff US Fish and Wildlife Office juvenile fish monitoring program
+ Metric Used: Estimated number of juvenile outmigrants passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam based on catches from rotory screw traps. Since winter Chinook spawning ground lie almost exclusively above the dam, this provides an estimate of salmon production from the upper reaches of the river.
+ Year Range: 2003-2017
+ Note: Data were truncated at 2003 to focus on the more recent trends. Data are also available for 1994-2000.

### Adult Delta Smelt: Spring Kodiak Trawl (Winter Report)
+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife
+ Metric Used: Annual abundance indices are the sum of the four (January-April) monthly indices, which are  calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for the three areas.
+ Year Range: 2002-2017
+ Stations: 39
+ Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Spring-Kodiak-Trawl



### Sacramento Pikeminnow – Beach Seine Survey (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: US Fish and Wildlife Service, Lodi Field Office, Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program 
+ Metric Used: For a given year-month combination, Sacramento Pikeminnow catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated as the sum of Pikeminnow catch divided by the sum of volume sampled, over all stations sampled. The annual index was calculated as the mean of the monthly CPUE values from that year.
+ Year Range:  1976-2018. 
+ Stations: 75 stations; see program metadata for site sampling histories.
+ Additional Information: https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm

### Delta Smelt: Summer Townet Survey (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife
+ Metric Used: Catches of age-zero Delta Smelt at each index station are weighted by a station-specific weighting factor,  summed for all index stations  and divided by 1000 to calculate the survey index. The annual index is calculated from the first two survey indices. This method was chosen for consistency with the index calculated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
+ Year Range: 1959-2018
+ Note: The Summer Townet Survey was initiated in 1959, but no index was calculated 1966-1968.
+ Stations: 31
+ Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey

### Microcystis (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: Summer Townet Survey and Environmental Monitoring Program
+ Metric Used: Microcystis bloom presence and intensity are measured on a qualitative scale with 5 categories: absent, low (widely scattered colonies), medium (adjacent colonies), high (contiguous colonies), and very high (concentration of contiguous colonies forming mats/scum).
+ Year Range: 2007 - 2018
+ Stations: 69
+ Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Water-Quality-Monitoring-And-Assessment

### Aquatic Vegetation (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: Acquired from Shruti Khanna at California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
+ Metric Used: Percent water area occupied by vegetation was estimated from hyperspectral imagery collected once per year. This metric was calculated for each of the two types of vegetation, floating and submerged, by dividing estimated acres of vegetation by estimated total wetted area of the Delta and multiplying by 100. Note that this is a conservative estimate of submerged aquatic vegetation because this type of vegetation is difficult to capture with remote sensing imagery. Also note that, although this plot is included in the summer report, the data were collected during most years in fall when vegetation biomass is at a maximum in the Delta.
+ Year Range: 2004-2018. For 2005-2007, vegetation coverage estimates are available but were not included in the plot because they are undergoing re-processing to better match methodologies used for the rest of the time series. No data were collected 2009-2013. These surveys have been funded in a piecemeal fashion and are not part of any agency’s formal monitoring program.
+ Stations: The coverage estimates included in the plot are based on an area representing about a third of the full legal delta, including parts of the Central and North Delta. These regions have been monitored because they represent important habitat for endangered delta smelt. The region for the Central Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Twitchell Island to the southern extent of Rhode Island in the north-south orientation and from the western extent of Sherman Island to eastern extent of Fourteen-Mile Slough in the east-west orientation. The region for the North Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Liberty Island to the southern extent of Prospect Island in the north-south orientation and the western extents of Lindsey Slough to the eastern extent of Prospect Island.
