## Overview
Long-term ecological surveys have been a core function of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) since the program’s inception in the 1970s. The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. While the report is not a comprehensive view of all the data collected by IEP, it is intended to provide a general overview of the longevity and breadth of IEP survey work. A major goal of this report is to illustrate the scope of IEP surveys and emerging trends in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem to the public, potential science collaborators, and IEP and other resource agency managers and directors. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication. 

## General Information

### Season Definitions
This report covers a suite of key IEP data sets relevant each season.For data sets collected throughout the year, such as water temperature, we only used data from this three-month period to generate graphs. For data sets that are season-specific, we include the entire sampling period, even if it does not overlap exactly with our season definition (for example, the 20mm Survey index includes data from March-July, whereas the spring season is defined as March-May).

* Spring = March to May
* Summer = June to August, 
* Fall = September to November, and  
* Winter = December to February, with January and February included with December of the previous year

### Geographic Region Definitions
Many of the data sets in the report are represented by a panel of three plots, one for each of three geographic regions: San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This subdivision of data sets is designed to facilitate comparison among major regions that differ in a variety of characteristics. San Pablo Bay includes data collected east of Point San Pablo and west of the Carquinez Straight. Suisun Bay includes data collected east of the Carquinez Straight and west of the town of Collinsville. The Delta includes data east of Collinsville. Data sets are represented as a single graph when the data are only collected within a single region (e.g., Net Delta Outflow) and for wide-ranging organisms that frequent multiple regions (e.g., Delta Smelt).

### Year Ranges
Most of the graphs in the report have an x-axis range from 1966 to 2018. This start year was selected because it is the year of initiation for the Fall Midwater Trawl survey, one of the longest-running surveys. Standardizing the year range on the x-axis facilitates visual comparison across data sets. The entire time series for nearly all data sets fits within this time range.  Data sets that started before 1966 were truncated in this report, for purposes of consistency within the report. The graphs in the Recent Trends section of the report range from 2004 to 2018. 

### Calculations for Data Points
The points plotted on the graphs represent mean values. Means are generated by averaging data over the three months of the season for a given year and across sites within a given region where relevant (e.g., water quality and plankton data sets). The dotted horizontal line indicates the average value over the entire period of record.

### Delta Smelt, Striped Bass, Longfin Smelt, American Shad: Fall Midwater Trawl  (Fall Report)

+ Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife
+ Metric Used: Annual abundance indices are the sum of the four (September-December) monthly indices, which are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for all 17 areas.
+ Year Range: 1967 – 2017. Note: No sampling in 1974 or 1979. Also, the month range of this survey deviates from the standard September -November definition of fall in this report. It typically takes place September – December. In some years past, however, it started as early as July and/or ended as late as March.
Stations: 100 (out of 122 stations sampled)

### Microcystis (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: Summer Townet Survey and Environmental Monitoring Program
+ Metric Used: Microcystis bloom presence and intensity are measured on a qualitative scale with 5 categories: absent, low (widely scattered colonies), medium (adjacent colonies), high (contiguous colonies), and very high (concentration of contiguous colonies forming mats/scum).
+ Year Range: 2007 - 2018
+ Stations: 69
+ Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Water-Quality-Monitoring-And-Assessment

### Aquatic Vegetation (Summer Report)

+ Data Source: Acquired from Shruti Khanna at California Department of Fish and Wildlife. 
+ Metric Used: Percent water area occupied by vegetation was estimated from hyperspectral imagery collected once per year. This metric was calculated for each of the two types of vegetation, floating and submerged, by dividing estimated acres of vegetation by estimated total wetted area of the Delta and multiplying by 100. Note that this is a conservative estimate of submerged aquatic vegetation because this type of vegetation is difficult to capture with remote sensing imagery. Also note that, although this plot is included in the summer report, the data were collected during most years in fall when vegetation biomass is at a maximum in the Delta.
+ Year Range: 2004-2018. For 2005-2007, vegetation coverage estimates are available but were not included in the plot because they are undergoing re-processing to better match methodologies used for the rest of the time series. No data were collected 2009-2013. These surveys have been funded in a piecemeal fashion and are not part of any agency’s formal monitoring program.
+ Stations: The coverage estimates included in the plot are based on an area representing about a third of the full legal delta, including parts of the Central and North Delta. These regions have been monitored because they represent important habitat for endangered delta smelt. The region for the Central Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Twitchell Island to the southern extent of Rhode Island in the north-south orientation and from the western extent of Sherman Island to eastern extent of Fourteen-Mile Slough in the east-west orientation. The region for the North Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Liberty Island to the southern extent of Prospect Island in the north-south orientation and the western extents of Lindsey Slough to the eastern extent of Prospect Island.
