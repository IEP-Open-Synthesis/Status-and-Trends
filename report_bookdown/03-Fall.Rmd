# Fall Report {#Fall}

#### Interagency Ecological Program Fall Season Report

This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for September through November from 1966 to 2018.


<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>

```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Fall flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports.
- The fall of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average.

## Fall Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Fall Water Temperature 



:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges.
* Increasing fall temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction.
* Fall temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Fall Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the fall.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam *Potamocorbula amurensis* caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Fall Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}
::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in fall tends to be higher than winter, but lower than summer.

## Fall Fish 

### Background

* The Fall Midwater Trawl began in 1967 and surveys the pelagic, or open water, fish community.  Indices for many pelagic fishes are at record lows, including Delta and Longfin Smelt which are  protected by California and/or federal Endangered Species Acts.
* White Sturgeon is a species of concern and a popular target of recreational fishing. Catch per unit
effort is based on trammel net surveys.
* Fall Run Chinook Salmon, an important species for both the commercial and recreational fishery, is  also a species of concern. Population dynamics are driven by hatchery production and a suite of  environmental variables. Totals counts of both in-river and hatchery returns are shown here.

## Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 

### Background

* Many pelagic fishes declined sharply around 2001 in what is known as the Pelagic Organism  Decline. Some species have continued to decline over the last 15 years.
* For Delta Smelt, 2018 marked the lowest recorded index on record (Index = 0).
* Most other pelagic fish also had low abundance in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the long-term average.
