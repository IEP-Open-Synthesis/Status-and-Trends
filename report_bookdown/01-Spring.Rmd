# Spring Report {#Spring}


#### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report
This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP 
surveys for March through May of 2018.


<h2>Delta Outflow</h2>
```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures","spring_outflow_update.png"))
```

- Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations.
- Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases.
- The spring of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average.

## Spring Secchi Depth 

:::::: {.columns2}

::: {.column width=700px}

### Background
* Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects.
* Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
* Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.

## Spring Water Temperature 

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width=800px}
## Background

* Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297). 
* Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges.
* Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction.
* Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

## Spring Chlorophyll

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Zooplankton

:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="70%"}
### Background


* Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297) but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. 
* Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. 
* Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food.
* Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

## Spring Fish 

### Background

* Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s [Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?packageid=edi.233.2). 
* Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW's [Fisheries Branch ](http://www.cbr.washington.edu/sacramento/data/query_adult_grandtab.html) based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. 
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

## Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 {#fishrecent}

### Background

* Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The [CDFW 20mm Survey](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/20mm-Survey) was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. 
* Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends.
* Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s [Chipps Island Trawl](https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm), located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.
