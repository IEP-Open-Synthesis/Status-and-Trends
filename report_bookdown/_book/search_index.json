Delta Outflow Figure 1: mean is represented by a dotted red line Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Fall flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports. The fall of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average. Fall Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 2: image of a secchi disk Average Secchi Depth by Region Figure 3: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Suisun Delta Figure 4: Graph of average fall secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. Figure 5: Graph of average fall secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. Figure 6: Graph of average fall secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. In 2018, Suisun Bay was slightly higher than the long-term average. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, continuing a trend of clearing water. For more information see: Schoellhamer, D. H. 2011. Sudden clearing of estuarine waters upon crossing the threshold from transport to supply regulation of sediment transport as an erodible sediment pool is depleted: San Francisco Bay, 1999. Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Fall Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing fall temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Fall temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Figure 11: Graph of average fall water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average. In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average. In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average. For more information see: Jeffries, et al. 2016.

Fall Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the fall. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

Values range from 4 to 15. Figure 15: Graph of average fall chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. Figure 16: Graph of average fall chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. In 2018, the Delta had lower chlorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018.

Fall Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in fall tends to be higher than winter, but lower than summer.

Values range from 5 to 25. Figure 21: Graph of average fall chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. Figure 22: Graph of average fall zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, San Pablo Bay had lower than average biomass, mostly cyclopoid copepods. In 2018, Suisun Bay had slighly higher than average total biomass, also mostly cyclopoid copepods. In 2018, the Delta had slightly higher than average total biomass.

Indices for many pelagic fishes are at record lows, including Delta and Longfin Smelt which are protected by California and/or federal Endangered Species Acts. White Sturgeon is a species of concern and a popular target of recreational fishing. Catch per unit effort is based on trammel net surveys. Fall Run Chinook Salmon, an important species for both the commercial and recreational fishery, is also a species of concern. Population dynamics are driven by hatchery production and a suite of environmental variables. Totals counts of both in-river and hatchery returns are shown here.

Values range from 40 to 20000. 2018 was lower than the longterm average. The 2018 longfin smelt index was much lower than average. In 2018, Young-of-the-year striped bass were much less abundant than average.

The 2018 American Shad index was much lower than average. 2018 was lower than the longterm average. In 2018, Fall Run Chinook returns were lower than average.

Available online: https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentId=151049&amp;inline Recent Trends: Fall Fish 2004-2018 Background Many pelagic fishes declined sharply around 2001 in what is known as the Pelagic Organism Decline. Some species have continued to decline over the last 15 years. For Delta Smelt, 2018 marked the lowest recorded index on record (Index = 0). Most other pelagic fish also had low catch in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the long-term average.

The Delta Smelt FMWT index was zero in 2018, the lowest index on record. The Longfin Smelt index remained much lower than the long-term average in 2018. In 2018, The Striped Bass index was the lowest on record. For more information see: Nobriga, M. L, &amp; Smith, W. E. (2020).
