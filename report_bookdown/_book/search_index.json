Delta Outflow Figure 1: mean is represented by a dotted red line Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases. The spring of 2018 had slightly lower outflow than average. Spring Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 2: image of a secchi disk Average Secchi Depth by Region Figure 3: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 4: Graph of average spring secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 5: Graph of average spring secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average Delta Figure 6: Graph of average spring secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest Spring on record. Schoellhamer, D. H. 2011.

Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Spring Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 10: Graph of average spring water temperature in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average. Delta Figure 11: Graph of average spring water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average. For more information see: Jeffries, et al.. 2016.

Spring Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay. Figure 12: picture of phytoplankton Average Chlorophyll by Region Figure 13: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 14: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 4 to 15. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 15: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 16: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta had lower chlorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Spring Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer. Copepod Figure 17: picture of a copepod Mysid Figure 18: picture of a copepod Average Zooplankton Biomass by Region Figure 19: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 20: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 25. In 2018, San Pablo Bay had much lower than average biomass, mostly calanoid copepods Suisun Figure 21: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass. Delta Figure 22: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, the Delta also had much lower than average total biomass.

Juvenile splittail are sampled by DWR’s Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program’s rotory screw trap. Spring-run Adult salmon return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW’s Fisheries Branch based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Values range from 4 to 80. Figure 28: Graph of average adult chinook returns from 1966 to 2018. Values range from 1000 to 250000. Figure 29: Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 1995 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6. 2018 did not have substantial Yolo Bypass flooding, and catch was in line with other similar years. In 2018, adult Chinook returns were lower than average In 2018, juvenile Chinook catch was slightly lower than average.

Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Recent Trends: Spring Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW 20mm Survey was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Values range from 0 to 15. Figure 35: Graph of post-larval longfin smelt index from 2004-2018. Values range from 4 to 206. Figure 36: Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 2004 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6. The Delta Smelt 20mm index was zero in 2018, the lowest index on record. Adult Longfin smelt catch in 2018 was much lower than the long-term average. In 2018, juvenile winter-run salmon survival was about average. Johnson, R., S. Windell, P. L. Brandes, J. L. Conrad, J. Ferguson, P. A. L. Goertler, B. N. Harvey, J. Heublein, J. A. Israel, D. W.
