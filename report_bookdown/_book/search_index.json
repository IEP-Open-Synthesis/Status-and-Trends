Delta Outflow Figure 1: mean is represented by a dotted red line Figure 2: average summer Delta outflow Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Summer flow is driven primarily upstream dam releases and exports. The summer of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average. Summer Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 3: image of a secchi disk Average Secchi Depth by Region Figure 4: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 5: Graph of average summer secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 6: Graph of average summer secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average Delta Figure 7: Graph of average summer secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest summer on record. For more information see: Schoellhamer, D. H. 2011. Sudden clearing of estuarine waters upon crossing the threshold from transport to supply regulation of sediment transport as an erodible sediment pool is depleted: San Francisco Bay, 1999. Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Summer Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing summer temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Summer temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 11: Graph of average summer water temperature in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average. Delta Figure 12: Graph of average summer water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average. For more information see: Jeffries, et al. 2016.

Summer Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the summer. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

Values range from 4 to 15. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 16: Graph of average summer chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 17: Graph of average summer chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta had lower chlorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Summer Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in summer tends to be the highest of the year, particularly for the calanoid copepod Pseudodiaptomous forbesi. Copepod Figure 18: picture of a copepod Mysid Figure 19: picture of a copepod Average Zooplankton Biomass by Region Figure 20: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 21: Graph of average summer zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 25. In 2018, San Pablo Bay had slightly higher biomass than average, mostly cyclopoid copepods. Suisun Figure 22: Graph of average summer chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had slightly higher than average total biomass, mostly mysids and cylcopoid copepdos. Delta Figure 23: Graph of average summer zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, the Delta had about average total biomass, mostly cladocerans.

Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Summer Fish Background Delta Smelt, listed as threatened by the Endangered Species Act, have been tracked by CDFW’s Townet Survey since 1959 in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and the Delta. Northern Anchovy are an important forage fish in the brackish-saline regions of the estuary. They are sampled best by CDFW’s San Francisco Bay Study. Sacramento Pikeminnow is a native cyprinid that is one of the few piscivorous native fish in the Delta. They are sampled by USFWS’s DJFMP beach seine surveys throughout the estuary.

Delta Smelt catch in 2018 was much lower than the longterm average. Bay Study has not been able to complete their surveys in recent years, but the most recent complete survey was about average. In 2018, Pikeminnow were less abundant than average. For more information see: Hieb, K., J. Bautista, and J. Giannetta. 2018.

Available on request: iepnewsletter@water.ca.gov Recent Trends: Summer 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt have been in severe decline over the past two decades, with a Summer Townet Survey index of zero in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Microcystis is a toxic cyanobacteria first found in the Delta in 1998. Microcystis presence has been documented by the Environmental Monitoring Program and the CDFW Summer Townet Survey during their water quality sampling. Aquatic vegetation in the Delta has increased significantly in recent years. This vegetation is composed mostly of non-native invasive plant species and is categorized as either floating or submerged types. Coverage is estimated by UC-Davis using remote sensing of the North and Central Delta.

Values range from 0 to 15. Figure 38: Graph of microcystis abundance fron 2007 to 2018 Figure 39: Graph of percent coverage of submerged and floating vegetation in the Delta. The Delta Smelt Townet index was zero in 2018, the lowest index on record. 2018 had more observations of very high Microcystis than previous years. In 2018, aquatic vegetation was slightly lower than 2017, but higher than average. For more information see: Ta et al. 2017.
