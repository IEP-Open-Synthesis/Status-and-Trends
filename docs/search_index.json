["Spring.html", "Spring Report Spring Secchi Depth Spring Water Temperature Background Spring Chlorophyll Zooplankton Spring Fish Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018", " Spring Report Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP surveys for March through May of 2018. Delta Outflow Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases. The spring of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average. Spring Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 3: image of a secchi disk Secchi Depth by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 4: Graph of average spring secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 5: Graph of average spring secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average Delta Figure 6: Graph of average spring secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest Spring on record. For more information see: Schoellhamer, D. H. 2011. Sudden clearing of estuarine waters upon crossing the threshold from transport to supply regulation of sediment transport as an erodible sediment pool is depleted: San Francisco Bay, 1999. Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Spring Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta. Figure 7: picture of a thermometer in water Temperature by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 8: Graph of average spring water temperature in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 9: Graph of average spring water temperature in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average. Delta Figure 10: Graph of average spring water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average. For more information see: Jeffries, et al.. 2016. Effects of high temperatures on threatened estuarine fishes during periods of extreme drought. The Journal of Experimental Biology 219(11):1705-1716. Spring Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay. Figure 11: picture of phytoplankton Average Spring Chlorophyll by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 12: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 4 to 15. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 13: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 14: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta had lower clorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass. Delta Figure 19: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, the Delta also had much lower than average total biomass. For more information see: Hennessy, A. 2018. Zooplankton Monitoring 2018. IEP Newsletter 32(1):21-32. Spring Fish Background Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program. Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW’s Fisheries Branch based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW 20mm Survey was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Winter Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the winter. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 102: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 103: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta also had about average chlorophyll. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Winter Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling during the winter did not begin until 1995. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in winter tends to be the lowest of the year.

Winter Fish Background White sturgeon support a recreational fishery. Juvenile sturgeon are sampled by in the CDFW Bay Study , which samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt are listed as Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. Spawning adults are sampled in winter by the CDFW Bay Study midwater trawl. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon are sampled by the Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW Spring Kodiak Trawl was designed to sample spawning Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so are better sampled by the CDFW Bay Study. The Bay Study samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.

The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. While the report is not a comprehensive view of all the data collected by IEP, it is intended to provide a general overview of the longevity and breadth of IEP survey work. A major goal of this report is to illustrate the scope of IEP surveys and emerging trends in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem to the public, potential science collaborators, and IEP and other resource agency managers and directors. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication. General Information Season Definitions This report covers a suite of key IEP data sets relevant to the spring season, which we defined as the months of March, April, and May. For data sets collected throughout the year, such as water temperature, we only used data from this three-month period to generate graphs. For data sets that are season-specific, we include the entire sampling period, even if it does not overlap exactly with our season definition (for example, the 20mm Survey index includes data from March-July). Data from other times of year will be featured in the corresponding future seasonal reports (i.e., winter, summer, fall). The other seasons (for future reports) are defined as follows: Summer = June to August, Fall = September to November, and Winter = December to February. Geographic Region Definitions Many of the data sets in the report are represented by a panel of three plots, one for each of three geographic regions: San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This subdivision of data sets is designed to facilitate comparison among major regions that differ in a variety of characteristics. San Pablo Bay includes data collected east of Point San Pablo and west of the Carquinez Straight. Suisun Bay includes data collected east of the Carquinez Straight and west of the town of Collinsville. The Delta includes data east of Collinsville. Data sets are represented as a single graph when the data are only collected within a single region (e.g., Net Delta Outflow) and for wide-ranging organisms that frequent multiple regions (e.g., Delta Smelt). Year Ranges Most of the graphs in the report have an x-axis range from 1966 to 2018. This start year was selected because it is the year of initiation for the Fall Midwater Trawl survey, one of the longest-running surveys. Standardizing the year range on the x-axis facilitates visual comparison across data sets. The entire time series for nearly all data sets fits within this time range. Data sets that started before 1966 were truncated in this report, for purposes of consistency within the report. The graphs in the Recent Trends section of the Spring report range from 2004 to 2018. Calculations for Data Points The points plotted on the graphs represent mean values. Means are generated by averaging data over the three months of the spring season for a given year (March-May) and across sites within a given region where relevant (e.g., water quality and plankton data sets). The dotted horizontal line indicates the average value over the entire period of record. ##Data Sets Flow Data Source: Department of Water Resources, Environmental Planning and Information Branch Metric Used: Net Delta Outflow Index, which is estimated using a summation of river inflows, precipitation, agricultural consumptive demand, and project exports. Year Range: 1966-2018. The entire data set includes 1929-2019 but was truncated to conform to the year range of the rest of the data sets in the report.
