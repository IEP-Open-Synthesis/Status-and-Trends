["Spring.html", "Spring Report Spring Secchi Depth Spring Water Temperature Background Spring Chlorophyll Zooplankton Spring Fish Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018", " Spring Report Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report This report shows trends in water quality, plankton, and fish across multiple IEP surveys for March through May of 2018. Delta Outflow Figure 3: mean is represented by a dotted red line Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases. The spring of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average. Spring Secchi Depth Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 4: image of a secchi disk Secchi Depth by Region Figure 5: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 6: Graph of average spring secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 7: Graph of average spring secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average Delta Figure 8: Graph of average spring secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest Spring on record. For more information see: Schoellhamer, D.

Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Spring Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Effects of high temperatures on threatened estuarine fishes during periods of extreme drought. The Journal of Experimental Biology 219(11):1705-1716. Spring Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 18: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta had lower clorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer.

Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass. Delta Figure 24: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, the Delta also had much lower than average total biomass. For more information see: Hennessy, A. 2018. Zooplankton Monitoring 2018. IEP Newsletter 32(1):21-32. Spring Fish Background Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program. Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW’s Fisheries Branch based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Average fish abundance by species Figure 25: mean is represented by a dotted red line Sacramento Splittail Adult Spring-Run Chinook Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Figure 26: picture of a sacramento splittail Figure 27: picture of an adults chinook salmon Figure 28: picture of a juvenile salmon Figure 29: Graph of average Sacramento Splittail catch per unit effort from 1998 to 2018.

Figure 31: Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 1995 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6. 2018 was lower than the long-term average. In 2018, adult Chinook returns were lower than average 2018 did not have substantial Yolo Bypass flooding, and catch was in line with other similar years. For more information see: Kwan, N., J. Jenkins, C. Stuart, A. Shakya, and B. Schreier. 2019. 2011-2016 Yolo Bypass Fisheries Monitoring Status and Trends Report. IEP Newsletter 36(1):27-36. Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW 20mm Survey was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

Summer Fish Background Delta Smelt, listed as threatened by the Endangered Spices Act, have been tracked by CDFW’s Townet Survey since 1959 in Suisun Bay, San Pablo Bay, and the Delta. Northern Anchovy are an important forage fish in the brackish-saline regions of the estuary. They are sampled best by CDFW’s San Francisco Bay Study. Sacramento Pikeminnow is a native cyprinid that is one of the few piscivorous native fish in the Delta. They are sampled by USFWS’s DJFMP beach seine surveys throughout the estuary.

Delta Smelt catch in 2018 was much lower than the longterm average. Bay Study has not been able to complete their survyes in recent years, but the most recent complete survey was about average. In 2018, Pikeminnow were less abundant than average. For more information see: For more information, see: Hieb, K., J. Bautista, and J. Giannetta. 2018. Bay Study Fishes Status and Trends Report for the San Francisco Estuary, 2012–2016. IEP Newsletter 31(2):3-43. Recent Trends: Summer 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt have been in severe decline over the past two decades, with a Summer Townet Survey index of zero in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Microcystis is a toxic cyanobacteria first found in the Delta in 1998. Microcystis presence has been documented by the Environmental Monitoring Program and the CDFW Summer Townet Survey during their water quality sampling. Aquatic vegetation in the Delta has increased significantly in recent years. This vegetation is composed mostly of non-native invasive plant species and is categorized as either floating or submerged types. Coverage is estimated by UC-Davis using remote sensing of the North and Central Delta.

Fall Fish Background The Fall Midwater Trawl began in 1967 and surveys the pelagic, or open water, fish community. Indices for many pelagic fishes are at record lows, including Delta and Longfin Smelt which are protected by California and/or federal Endangered Species Acts. White Sturgeon is a species of concern and a popular target of recreational fishing. Catch per unit effort is based on trammel net surveys. Fall Run Chinook Salmon, an important species for both the commercial and recreational fishery, is also a species of concern. Population dynamics are driven by hatchery production and a suite of environmental variables. Totals counts of both in-river and hatchery returns are shown here.

Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 Background Many pelagic fishes declined sharply around 2001 in what is known as the Pelagic Organism Decline. Some species have continued to decline over the last 15 years. For Delta Smelt, 2018 marked the lowest recorded index on record (Index = 0). Most other pelagic fish also had low abundance in 2018 when compared to 2017 and the long-term average.

Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Winter Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Productivity, fish growth, and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing winter temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction and allow invasive aquatic plants to survive the winter. Winter temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

Effects of high temperatures on threatened estuarine fishes during periods of extreme drought. The Journal of Experimental Biology 219(11):1705-1716. Winter Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the winter. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay. Figure 128: picture of phytoplankton Average Chlorophyll by Region Figure 129: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 130: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 8. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 131: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 132: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta also had about average chlorophyll. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Winter Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling during the winter did not begin until 1995. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in winter tends to be the lowest of the year. Copepod Figure 133: picture of a copepod Mysid Figure 134: picture of a copepod Average Zooplankton Biomass by Region Figure 135: mean is represented by a dotted red line San Pablo Bay Figure 136: Graph of average winter zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3 to 16. In 2018, San Pablo Bay had much lower than average biomass, mostly calanoid copepods Suisun Figure 137: Graph of average winter chlorophyll in Suisun from 1995 to 2018. Values range from .5 to 5. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass. Delta Figure 138: Graph of average winter zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1995 to 2018.

Winter Fish Background White sturgeon support a recreational fishery. Juvenile sturgeon are sampled by in the CDFW Bay Study , which samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt are listed as Threatened under the California Endangered Species Act. Spawning adults are sampled in winter by the CDFW Bay Study midwater trawl. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon are sampled by the Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.

IEP Newsletter 31(2):3-43. Recent Trends: Winter Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW Spring Kodiak Trawl was designed to sample spawning Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so are better sampled by the CDFW Bay Study. The Bay Study samples throughout the San Francisco Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Delta.

["metadata.html", "Metadata Overview General Information Data Sets", " Metadata Interagency Ecological Program Seasonal Monitoring Report, Spring 2018 Version: 1.0 Last Updated: 2020-03-09 Report developed by: Rosemary Hartman (California Department of Water Resources (CDWR, Rosemary.Hartman@water.ca.gov) Nicholas Rasmussen (CDWR) Lara Mitchell (US Fish and Wildlife Service) JohnFranco Saraceno (CDWR) David Bosworth (CDWR) Jason DuBois (California Department of Fish and Wildlife) Michael Koohafkan (CDWR) Louise Conrad (Delta Science Program) Sam Bashevkin (Delta Science Program) Overview Long-term ecological surveys have been a core function of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) since the program’s inception in the 1970s. The IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report presents the full time series for selected water quality, plankton, and fisheries surveys conducted by IEP in a single graphical report. While the report is not a comprehensive view of all the data collected by IEP, it is intended to provide a general overview of the longevity and breadth of IEP survey work. A major goal of this report is to illustrate the scope of IEP surveys and emerging trends in the San Francisco Bay-Delta ecosystem to the public, potential science collaborators, and IEP and other resource agency managers and directors. The report is generated on a quarterly basis, with different set of ecosystem variables and surveys highlighted in each season. The report is developed by IEP scientists (including leads for monitoring surveys and the IEP Lead Scientist) and is reviewed by the IEP Science Management Team and Coordinators before online publication. General Information Season Definitions This report covers a suite of key IEP data sets relevant each season.For data sets collected throughout the year, such as water temperature, we only used data from this three-month period to generate graphs. For data sets that are season-specific, we include the entire sampling period, even if it does not overlap exactly with our season definition (for example, the 20mm Survey index includes data from March-July, whereas the spring season is defined as March-May). Spring = March to May Summer = June to August, Fall = September to November, and Winter = December to February, with January and February included with December of the previous year Geographic Region Definitions Many of the data sets in the report are represented by a panel of three plots, one for each of three geographic regions: San Pablo Bay, Suisun Bay, and the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This subdivision of data sets is designed to facilitate comparison among major regions that differ in a variety of characteristics. San Pablo Bay includes data collected east of Point San Pablo and west of the Carquinez Straight. Suisun Bay includes data collected east of the Carquinez Straight and west of the town of Collinsville. The Delta includes data east of Collinsville. Data sets are represented as a single graph when the data are only collected within a single region (e.g., Net Delta Outflow) and for wide-ranging organisms that frequent multiple regions (e.g., Delta Smelt). Year Ranges Most of the graphs in the report have an x-axis range from 1966 to 2018. This start year was selected because it is the year of initiation for the Fall Midwater Trawl survey, one of the longest-running surveys. Standardizing the year range on the x-axis facilitates visual comparison across data sets. The entire time series for nearly all data sets fits within this time range. Data sets that started before 1966 were truncated in this report, for purposes of consistency within the report. The graphs in the Recent Trends section of the report range from 2004 to 2018. Calculations for Data Points The points plotted on the graphs represent mean values. Means are generated by averaging data over the three months of the season for a given year and across sites within a given region where relevant (e.g., water quality and plankton data sets). The dotted horizontal line indicates the average value over the entire period of record. Data Sets Flow (All Seasons) Data Source: Department of Water Resources, Environmental Planning and Information Branch Metric Used: Net Delta Outflow Index, which is estimated using a summation of river inflows, precipitation, agricultural consumptive demand, and project exports. Year Range: 1966-2018. The entire data set includes 1929-2019 but was truncated to conform to the year range of the rest of the data sets in the report.

Metric Used: The CDFW Fisheries Branch Anadromous Resource Assessment Unit compiles annual population estimates of Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, in the Sacramento San Joaquin River system. The GrandTab report is a compilation of sources estimating the late-fall, winter, spring, and fall-run Chinook salmon total populations for streams surveyed. Estimates are based on counts of fish entering hatcheries and migrating past dams, carcass surveys, live fish counts, and ground and aerial redd counts. Estimates are provided by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the California Department of Water Resources, the East Bay Municipal Utilities District, the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Lower Yuba River Management Team, and the Fisheries Foundation of California.

Year Range: 1967 – 2017. Note: No sampling in 1974 or 1979. Also, the month range of this survey deviates from the standard September -November definition of fall in this report. It typically takes place September – December. In some years past, however, it started as early as July and/or ended as late as March. Stations: 100 (out of 122 stations sampled) Additional Information: http://www.dfg.ca.gov/delta/projects.asp?ProjectID=FMWT Adult White Sturgeon: Sturgeon Study (Fall Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, Sturgeon Study Metric Used: Catch per unit effort based on standardized trammel net surveys Year Range: 1967-2017. Survey conducted intermittently 1967-2004 and annually since 2005. Note: Fall season for this study is August-October. Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Sturgeon-Study Juvenile White Sturgeon: San Francisco Bay Study (Winter Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, San Francisco Bay Study (Region 3, Bay Delta) Metric Used: Year-class index (YCI) calculated by methods described in Fish 2010 Data source: Fish CPUE and Index calc_July2019.accdb (standalone database, copy received from Bay Study personnel) Year Range: 1980-present. Annual survey conducted monthly in the bays, estuary, &amp; delta. Deploys otter &amp; mid-water trawls. Sturgeon YCI calculated using otter trawl only (Fish 2010). Stations: 52 Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study Adult Longfin Smelt and Northern Anchovy: San Francisco Bay Study (Winter and Summer Reports) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife, San Francisco Bay Study (Region 3, Bay Delta) Metric Used: Average catch per unit effort (CPUE) for adult (Age 1+) Longfin Smelt is derived from Bay Study’s Midwater trawl, which samples pelagic fishes and retrieved obliquely such that all depths are sampled equally. Year Range: 1980-2017 Stations: 52 Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study Winter Run Chinook: Red Bluff Diversion Dam (Winter Report) Data Source: Red Bluff US Fish and Wildlife Office juvenile fish monitoring program Metric Used: Estimated number of juvenile outmigrants passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam based on catches from rotory screw traps. Since winter Chinook spawning ground lie almost exclusively above the dam, this provides an estimate of salmon production from the upper reaches of the river. Year Range: 2003-2017 Note: Data were truncated at 2003 to focus on the more recent trends. Data are also available for 1994-2000. Stations: 4 screw traps across the river Additional Information: https://www.fws.gov/redbluff/rbdd_jsmp.html Adult Delta Smelt: Spring Kodiak Trawl (Winter Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife Metric Used: Annual abundance indices are the sum of the four (January-April) monthly indices, which are calculated by averaging catch per tow for index stations in each regional area, multiplying these means by their respective weighting factors (i.e., a scalar based on water volume) for each area and summing these products for the three areas. Year Range: 2002-2017 Stations: 39 Additional Information: https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Spring-Kodiak-Trawl Sacramento Pikeminnow – Beach Seine Survey (Summer Report) Data Source: US Fish and Wildlife Service, Lodi Field Office, Delta Juvenile Fish Monitoring Program Metric Used: For a given year-month combination, Sacramento Pikeminnow catch per unit effort (CPUE) was calculated as the sum of Pikeminnow catch divided by the sum of volume sampled, over all stations sampled. The annual index was calculated as the mean of the monthly CPUE values from that year. Year Range: 1976-2018. Stations: 75 stations; see program metadata for site sampling histories. Additional Information: https://www.fws.gov/lodi/juvenile_fish_monitoring_program/jfmp_index.htm Delta Smelt: Summer Townet Survey (Summer Report) Data Source: California Department of Fish and Wildlife Metric Used: Catches of age-zero Delta Smelt at each index station are weighted by a station-specific weighting factor, summed for all index stations and divided by 1000 to calculate the survey index. The annual index is calculated from the first two survey indices. This method was chosen for consistency with the index calculated by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Year Range: 1959-2018 Note: The Summer Townet Survey was initiated in 1959, but no index was calculated 1966-1968. Stations: 31 Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey Microcystis (Summer Report) Data Source: Summer Townet Survey and Environmental Monitoring Program Metric Used: Microcystis bloom presence and intensity are measured on a qualitative scale with 5 categories: absent, low (widely scattered colonies), medium (adjacent colonies), high (contiguous colonies), and very high (concentration of contiguous colonies forming mats/scum). Year Range: 2007 - 2018 Stations: 69 Additional Information: https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Townet-Survey https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Water-Quality-Monitoring-And-Assessment Aquatic Vegetation (Summer Report) Data Source: Acquired from Shruti Khanna at California Department of Fish and Wildlife. Metric Used: Percent water area occupied by vegetation was estimated from hyperspectral imagery collected once per year. This metric was calculated for each of the two types of vegetation, floating and submerged, by dividing estimated acres of vegetation by estimated total wetted area of the Delta and multiplying by 100. Note that this is a conservative estimate of submerged aquatic vegetation because this type of vegetation is difficult to capture with remote sensing imagery. Also note that, although this plot is included in the summer report, the data were collected during most years in fall when vegetation biomass is at a maximum in the Delta. Year Range: 2004-2018. For 2005-2007, vegetation coverage estimates are available but were not included in the plot because they are undergoing re-processing to better match methodologies used for the rest of the time series. No data were collected 2009-2013. These surveys have been funded in a piecemeal fashion and are not part of any agency’s formal monitoring program. Stations: The coverage estimates included in the plot are based on an area representing about a third of the full legal delta, including parts of the Central and North Delta. These regions have been monitored because they represent important habitat for endangered delta smelt. The region for the Central Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Twitchell Island to the southern extent of Rhode Island in the north-south orientation and from the western extent of Sherman Island to eastern extent of Fourteen-Mile Slough in the east-west orientation. The region for the North Delta ranges from the northernmost extent of Liberty Island to the southern extent of Prospect Island in the north-south orientation and the western extents of Lindsey Slough to the eastern extent of Prospect Island.
