Delta Outflow Freshwater flow influences water quality, plankton, and fish populations. Spring flow is driven primarily by rainfall, snowmelt, and upstream dam releases. The spring of 2018 had somewhat slightly lower outflow than average. Spring Secchi Depth Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report Background Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity. Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears. Figure 1: image of a secchi disk Secchi Depth by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 2: Graph of average spring secchi depth in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 150. In 2018, San Pablo bay was close to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 3: Graph of average spring secchi depth in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 10 to 60. In 2018, Suisun Bay was also close to the long-term average Delta Figure 4: Graph of average spring secchi depth in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 25 to 120 and have been increasing since the year 2000. In 2018, the Delta was much clearer than average, the clearest Spring on record. For more information see: Schoellhamer, D.

Estuaries and Coasts 34(5):885-899. Spring Water Temperature Background Water temperature is monitored monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. Fish growth and reproduction is highest in certain temperature ranges. Increasing Spring temperatures may lower Delta Smelt reproduction. Spring temperatures are lower closer to the ocean and slightly higher in the Delta.

In 2018, San Pablo Bay temperatures were similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 7: Graph of average spring water temperature in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, Suisun Bay was similar to the long-term average. Delta Figure 8: Graph of average spring water temperature in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 13 to 18. In 2018, the Delta was slightly cooler than average. For more information see: Jeffries, et al.. 2016. Effects of high temperatures on threatened estuarine fishes during periods of extreme drought. The Journal of Experimental Biology 219(11):1705-1716. Spring Chlorophyll Background Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring. Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s Environmental Monitoring Program. The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay. Figure 9: picture of phytoplankton Average Spring Chlorophyll by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 10: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 4 to 15. In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average. Suisun Figure 11: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19. In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average. Delta Figure 12: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29. In 2018, the Delta had lower clorophyll than average. For more information see: Cahoon, T. and T. Brown. 2018. Phytoplankton, Chlorophyll-a and Pheophytin-a Status and Trends 2017. IEP Newsletter 32(1):14-20. Zooplankton Background Zooplankton is sampled monthly by the CDFW/DWR Environmental Monitoring Program but sampling in San Pablo Bay did not begin until 1998. Zooplankton are an important food source for pelagic fish. Calanoid copepods and mysids are particularly good fish food. Cyclopoid copepods are not as good for fish food. Biomass in Spring tends to be higher than Winter, but lower than Summer. Copepod Figure 13: picture of a copepod Mysid Figure 14: picture of a copepod Average Spring Zooplankton Biomass by Region San Pablo Bay Figure 15: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 25. In 2018, San Pablo Bay had much lower than average biomass, mostly calanoid copepods Suisun Figure 16: Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 5 to 45 with much higher biomass before 1986. In 2018, Suisun Bay also had much lower than average total biomass. Delta Figure 17: Graph of average spring zooplankton biomass in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 39. In 2018, the Delta also had much lower than average total biomass.

Spring Fish Background Splittail are a native minnow that spawn on floodplains, so have high reproduction during high flow years when floodplains are inundated with water. They are sampled by DWR’s Yolo Bypass Monitoring Program. Spring-run Adult salmon returns return from the ocean during the spring. Populations are calculated by CDFW’s Fisheries Branch based on redd counts, carcass surveys, fish entering hatcheries, and live fish counts. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. :::::: Average fish abundance by species Sacramento Splittail Figure 18: picture of a sacramento splittail Figure 19: Graph of average Sacramento Splittail catch per unit effort from 1998 to 2018. Values range from 4 to 80. 2018 was lower than the long-term average. Adult Spring-Run Chinook Figure 20: picture of an adults chinook salmon Figure 21: Graph of average adult chinook returns from 1966 to 2018. Values range from 1000 to 250000. In 2018, adult Chinook returns were lower than average Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Figure 22: picture of a juvenile salmon Figure 23: Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 1995 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6. In 2018, juvenile winter-run salmon survival was about average. For more information see: Kwan, N., J. Jenkins, C. Stuart, A. Shakya, and B.

Recent Trends: Fish 2004-2018 Background Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt have been in decline since the early 2000s. The CDFW 20mm Survey was designed to sample post-larval and juvenile Delta Smelt, and samples in San Pablo, Suisun, and the Delta. Longfin Smelt frequently spawn further downstream than Delta Smelt, so the 20 mm Survey does not cover their entire range, but still provides an indication of population-level trends. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Salmon out-migrate to the ocean in spring, and are sampled by the USFWS’s Chipps Island Trawl, located at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. Average fish abundance by species Delta Smelt Figure 24: picture of longfin smelt Figure 25: Graph of post-larval Delta Smelt index from 2004-2018. Values range from 0 to 15. The Delta Smelt 20mm index was zero in 2018, the lowest index on record. Longfin smelt Figure 26: picture of longfin smelt Figure 27: Graph of post-larval longfin smelt index from 2004-2018. Values range from 4 to 206. Adult Longfin smelt abundance in 2018 was much lower than the long-term average. Juvenile Winter-Run Chinook Figure 28: picture of a juvenile salmon Figure 29: Graph of juvenile winter-run chinook index from 2004 to 2018. Values range from 0.2 to 6. In 2018, juvenile winter-run salmon survival was about average. For more information see: Kwan, N., J. Jenkins, C. Stuart, A. Shakya, and B.
