# Chlorophyll {#chlorophyll}

### Interagency Ecological Program Spring Season report

## Background

* Chlorophyll is an indicator of phytoplankton production, which is low during the Spring.
* Phytoplankton are the base of the pelagic food web. It is sampled monthly by DWR’s [Environmental Monitoring Program](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/wiki/12297).
* The invasion of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis caused a decline in phytoplankton and zooplankton after 1986 – especially in Suisun Bay.

## Average Spring Chlorophyll by Region 


:::::: {.columns-nocenter}

::: {.column width="30%"}

<center> __San Pablo Bay__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring chlorophyll in San Pablo Bay from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 4 to 15.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/chla_splspring.png"))
```

In 2018, San Pablo Bay chlorophyll was similar to the long-term average.

<center> __Suisun__ </center>
```{r fig.cap= "Graph of average spring chlorophyll in Suisun from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 2 to 19.", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/chla_ssspring.png"))
```

In 2018, Suisun Bay chlorophyll was also about average.

<center> __Delta__ </center>
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.cap= "Graph of average spring chlorophyll in the Delta from 1975 to 2018. Values range from 3.5 to 29."}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("figures/chla_dtspring.png"))
```

In 2018, the Delta had lower clorophyll than average.
