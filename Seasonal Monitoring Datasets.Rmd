## IEP Seasonal Monitoring Report: Datasets

### Dayflow: Net Delta Outflow index

Study description: [DWR website](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Environmental-Services/Compliance-Monitoring-And-Assessment/Dayflow-Data)

Data location: [CNRA portal](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/dayflow)

Data format: comma delimited files (.csv)

Range: 1929-present

Notes: For now, this is just a file generated by hand.


### Environmental Monitoring Program (DWR): Temperature, NO3-/NO2-/NH4+, Turbidity, Chlorophyll-a, Secchi Depth

Study description: [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11285)

Data location: [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11285) 

Data format: Microsoft Excel files (.xls)

Range: 1979-present

Notes: For now, these data have to be downloaded by hand.

### Zooplankton Survey (CDFW): Zooplankton

Study description: [Bay Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11281)
Data location: [CDFW FTP site](ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/IEP_Zooplankton/) OR [Bay-Delta Live](https://emp.baydeltalive.com/projects/11281)

Data format: Microsoft Excel files (.xlsx)

Range: 1979-present

Primary Data File(s): 

* 1972-2018CBMatrix.xlsx (tab = CB CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)
* 1972-2018PumpMatrix.xlsx (tab = Pump CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)
* 1972-2018MysidMatrix.xlsx (tab = Mysid CPUE Matrix 1972-2018)

Supporting Data File(s): 1972-2017MysidMatrix.xlsx (tab = StationLookup)

Notes: CPUE is available for all three sampling types (CB, Mysid, Pump) but not the BPUE or even the taxon-specific biomass estimates. I could ask April to add that info to the FTP site. In the meantime, I do have files for this. StationLookup is needed because the GPS coordinates for stations are needed to group stations into geographic regions. The StationLookup from the Mysid Net dataset works best because the StationLookup datasets for the other two surveys are just subsets of this one.

### Bay Study (CDFW): Longfin Smelt, Juvenile Sturgeon, Anchovy 

Study description: [CDFW Website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/Bay-Study)

Data location: [CDFW FTP site](ftp://ftp.wildlife.ca.gov/BayStudy/CatchMatrices/)

Data format: Excel files (.xlsx)

Range: 1980-present

Primary Data File(s): 
* Bay Study_FishCatchMatrices_1980-2017.zip, which contains: 
* Bay Study_MWT_1980-2017_FishMarix.xlsx and 
* Bay Study_OT_1980-2017_FishMatrix.xlsx

### 20mm survey (CDFW): Delta Smelt

Study description: [CDFW Website](https://wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Delta/20mm-Survey)

Data location: [CDFW FTP site](ftp://ftp.dfg.ca.gov/Delta%20Smelt/)

Data format: Microsoft Access database (.accdb)

Range: 2004-present

Primary Data File(s): 20mm_New.accdb (probably should include all tables) 

Note: Queries for calculating CPUE and fish indecies are in [SQLQueries_20mm_New.accdb.pdf]()
