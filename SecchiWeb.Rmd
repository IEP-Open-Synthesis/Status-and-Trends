## Background
- Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. 
- Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
- Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWRâ€™s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.
- Suisun Bay tends to have the lowest Secchi depth due to its extensive shallow areas and high winds.
