## Background
- Organisms in this ecosystem are adapted to high turbidity conditions, and reductions in turbidity can have many negative ecological effects. 
- Higher values for Secchi depth indicate lower turbidity.
- Secchi depth is measured monthly by DWRâ€™s Environmental Monitoring Program by dropping a black-and-white disk in the water until it disappears.
- Suisun Bay tends to have the lowest Secchi depth due to its extensive shallow areas and high winds.

### San Pablo Bay
```{r, out.width= 500, echo = F, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("winter_report/latex/figures/secchi/secchi_san_pablo_bay_tmp.png")

```
In 2017, San Pablo bay was clearer than the long-term average.

### Suisun Bay
```{r, out.width= 500, echo = F, fig.align='center'}
include_graphics("winter_report/latex/figures/secchi/secchi_suisun_bay_tmp.png")

```
In 2017, San Pablo bay was clearer than the long-term average.
